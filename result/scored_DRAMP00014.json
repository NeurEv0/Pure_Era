This peptide was detected in five Geobacillus strains. Geobacillin I contains seven thioether cross-links, the highest degree of links in known lantibiotics. The thioether rings are as follows: S3-C7, T8-C11, T13-C18, T20-C24, S23-C27, S26-C30, and S29-C33 (determined by NMR). In addition, residues T2 and S5 are dehydrated into Dhb and Dha. This peptide appears to share rings 1 and 2 with nisin, but is more stable than nisin. Therefore, this peptide may be developed as a better version of nisin widely used in food preservation.",
