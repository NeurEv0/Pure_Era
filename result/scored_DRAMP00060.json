In addition, addition of Lys19 to dehydralanine at position 6 forms a lysinoalanine bridge.  The Asp residue at position 15 is hydroxylated.MOA:bacteria: Duramycins and cinnamycin specifically binds to phosphatidylethanolamine, thereby indirectly inhibiting the activity of phospholipase A2.Structure: Structure of cinnamycin complexed with lysophosphatidylethanolamine has been solved.You can rotate, zoom, and view the Greek key-like beta sheet structureherein the PDB.Updated 12/2024",
