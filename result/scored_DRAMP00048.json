      "additional_info": "Chemical modification:  There are  two di-dehydroalanines (Dha), S3, S31; one di-dehydrobutyrine (Dhb), T18; one lanthionine, S3-C7; and four methyllanthionines, T8-C11, T13-C19, T23-C26, and T25-C28 (provided by T. Stein). In addiiton, this peptide can be succinylated via Trp, leading to reduced activity (Chan et al., 1993).Activity:  subtilin inhibits B. cereus T spore outgrowth at a very low concentration of 80 nM. In addition, f vegetative B. cereus was lysed at 8 ug/ml. spore is a dormant, reproductive cell whereas vegetative cell is any cell that does not produce gametes.MOA:  The peptide antibiotic subtilin acts by formation of voltage-dependent multi-state pores in bacterial and artificial membranes (Sch√ºller F et al., 1989).Natural variant: [N-alpha-succinyl-Trp1]subtilin has been isolated from Bacillus subtilis A.T.C.C. 6633 (Chan et al., 1993). A total chemical synthesis [N alpha-Succinyl-Trp1]-subtilin is produced later in the growth of the bacterium. After 24 h, the ratio of subtilin/modified form=1:2. This modification reduced antibacterial activity by 10-20 fold.Recombinant production:bacteria:Bacillus subtilis: Stein and colleague improved the production of subtilin inBacillus subtilisATCC 6633 via adopting two strategies: (1) additional copies of self-protection immunity gene spaIFEG (1.7 fold increase of expression) and (2) deletion of a repressor of subtilin gene expression, leading to 6 fold increase. Interestingly, the major form of the expressed form is succinylated subtilin with reduced antibacterial activity (Heinzmann S et al., 2006).Updated 7/2021; Jan2022; 12/2022; Jan2025",
