**Record every process of data collation**
illustrate:
- In the process of merging two data sets each time, the sequence information is used for duplication checking. For each antimicrobial peptide in the intersection of the two data sets, its valid information in the two data sets is merged.


## Raw Data
1. **LAMP:** 
    - number of LAMP: 23253
2. **DRAMP**
    - number of DRAMP(**data cleaned**): 52763
        - clinical: 55
        - expanded: 11607
        - general: 11606
        - patent: 17886
        - stability: 11609
