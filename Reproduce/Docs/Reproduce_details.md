# Reproduce details

- **Reproduce project**: 
  - üÜïPaper title: Explainable deep learning and virtual evolution identifies antimicrobial peptides with activity against multidrug-resistant human pathogens
  - üÜïPaper link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01907-3
  - üñ•Ô∏ègithub link: https://github.com/MicroResearchLab/AMP-potency-prediction-EvoGradient.git

## Reproducing
‚≠êÔ∏èü§ù**When we checked the github repository, we found that there was no training code for the deep learning model. So we looked for the training strategy in the paper and completed the writing of the training code. In addition, there are some things in this github project that don't seem reasonable. Therefore, we have tried our best to keep the author's ideas, but made some necessary adjustments. Due to the particularity of swanlab, there are many repeated parts in the reproduction code.**
