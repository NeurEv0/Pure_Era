        "Function": "Lanthionine-containing peptide antibiotic (lantibiotic) active on Gram-positive bacteria. The bactericidal activity of lantibiotics is based on depolarization of energized bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, initiated by the formation of aqueous transmembrane pores (By similarity).",
        "Biophysicochemical properties": "pH dependence (Optimum pHs for antimicrobial activity are 3.0 and 6.0. Activity is reduced by 50% at alkaline pHs 9.0 and 11.0); Temperature dependence (No change in antimicrobial activity between 80 or 100 degrees Celsius after 15 minutes, but reduction in 50% antimicrobial activity at 121 degrees Celsius after 15 minutes).",
        "ptm": "Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether bonds with cysteine. This is followed by membrane translocation and cleavage of the modified precursor (By similarity).",
