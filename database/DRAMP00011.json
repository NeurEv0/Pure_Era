        "Function": "Plantaricin W (Plw) is a new two-peptide bacteriocin, from Lactobacillus plantarum, which inhibits a large number of Gram-positive bacteria. The two individual peptides, Plwalpha (comprising 29 residues) and Plwbeta (comprising 32 residues), had low antimicrobial activity but acted synergistically. The data indicate that the two peptides work in a 1",
        "PTM": "Chemical analyses showed that both peptides are lantibiotics, but two unmodified cysteines and one serine residue were present in Plwa, and Plwb contained one cysteine residue. Plwbeta is synthesized with a 29 aa leader, processed by an ABC transporter and then subjected to further proteolytic attack, resulting in the removal of the six Nterminal residues.",
