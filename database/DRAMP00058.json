        "Methyllanthionine rings between residues 1 and18 as well as between residues 5 and 11; a lanthionine occurs between Cys14 and residue 4. In addition, addition of Lys19 to dehydralanine at position 6 forms a lysinoalanine bridge. The Asp residue at position 15 is hydroxylated. Duramycins and cinnamycin specifically binds to phosphatidylethanolamine, thereby indirectly inhibiting the activity of phospholipase A2.": "",
