        "Two possible structures have been proposed for streptin 1 due to insufficient info. The first lanthionine S3-C7 and the second methyllanthionine T8-C12 are identical in the two proposed structures. A third intra-bond is either S11-C17 or C17-T19 (or C17-T20 or C17-T21). Compared to Streptin 1, Streptin 2 contains 3 additional residues TPY at the N-terminus. Small quantities of peptides at various degrees of dehydration were also detected.": "",
