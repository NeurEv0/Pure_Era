        "Miscellaneous": "A longer form (streptin 2, with three more amino acids at the N-terminus) is probably due to incomplete processing. Other forms also exist, some of which are due to differing levels of dehydration.",
        "PTM": "Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether bonds with cysteine. This is followed by membrane translocation and cleavage of the modified precursor.",
