        "Function": "Plant non-specific lipid-transfer proteins transfer phospholipids as well as galactolipids across membranes. Binds cis-unsaturated fatty acids and jasmonic acid with a higher affinity than linear chain fatty acids. Formation of the complex with jasmonic acid results in a conformational change facilitating the LPT1 binding on the elicitin plasma membrane receptor that is known to be involved in plant defense induction. May also play a role in wax or cutin deposition in the cell walls of expanding epidermal cells and certain secretory tissues.",
        "Tissue specificity": "High expression in leaf epidermis and shoot apex, and also in root epidermis during seedling germination.",
        "PTM": "Contains four disulfide bonds.",
