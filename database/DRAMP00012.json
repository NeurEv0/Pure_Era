        "Function": "The mature peptides, Lchalpha and Lchbeta, interact synergistically to possess antibiotic activity against Gram-positive bacteria within a nanomolar concentration range, though the individual peptides were shown to be active at micromolar concentrations. The bactericidal activity of lantibiotics is based on depolarization of energized bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, initiated by the formation of aqueous transmembrane pores. Combined LchA1 and LchA2 peptides also inhibit Bacillus sp. HIL-Y85/54728, L.lactis DPC3417 and B.halodurans C-125, which produce lantibiotics themselves. Inactivated by proteinase K and pronase E, but not by trypsin and chymotrypsin.",
        "PTM": "Maturation of lantibiotics involves the enzymic conversion of Thr, and Ser into dehydrated AA and the formation of thioether bonds with cysteine. This is followed by membrane translocation and cleavage of the modified precursor.",
