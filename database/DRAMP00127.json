There is some flexibility in the helix in the kink region. The helix in plnF is polar in its N-terminal half and amphiphilic in its C-terminal half. plnF has one such motif at residues 30 to 34. The helix in plnF is polar in its N-terminal half and amphiphilic in its C-terminal half. PlnF has one GxxxG motif at residues 30 to 34.",
